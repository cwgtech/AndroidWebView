# AndroidUnityWebView

This extends the base plugin with a OpenWebView method, allowing an Android WebView to be created, loaded, and then displayed and interacted with on top of Unity.

This tutorial creates a LinearLayout, a TextView, and a WebView. The TextView is used to allow for a blank space at the top of the layout, so some portion of the Unity screen is still visible and can be interacted with.

The WebView uses a default WebViewClient that allows links to be opened inside the WebView instead of presenting a picker to the user.

This tutorial was made with Unity 2017.3.0f3, Visual Studio Community for Mac 7.4, and Android Studio 3.0.1
